# Glitch Effect

(+๑-ᴗ-๑) - "Glitch Effect ?"

## What was used ?

SASS: `npm install -g sass`

### Use Sass Preprocessing

- watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass:
  - `sass --watch input.scss output.css`

- watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output:
  - `sass --watch assets/sass:assets/css`

* sass would **watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder**
